# HEART-PULSE-RATE-MONITORING
Heart Beat Detection and Monitoring System using Arduino UNO that detects the heart beat using the Pulse Sensor and will  readings to ThingSpeak server using the Wi-Fi module ESP8266, so that Heart Beats can be monitored from anywhere in the world over the internet.
## Getting Started

In this project we are going to make a Heart Beat Detection and Monitoring System using Arduino that will detect the heart beat using the Pulse Sensor and will show the readings in BPM (Beats Per Minute) on the LCD connected to it and also to ThingSpeak servers using its API to visualize and analyse data received.
